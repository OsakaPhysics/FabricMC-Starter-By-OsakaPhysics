Fabric Testing Mod for 1.20.1 (Includes general stuff and some random goodies—because who doesn't love free stuff?)

This is a silly example Fabric mod, perfect for learning, coding, or just having fun! It's packed with cool features, some of which are actually useful, and others that... well, are there for fun! It also includes some kinda helpful comments (don’t expect too much, though).

This mod is licensed under the MIT License. The Fabric magic and stuff come from the awesome folks at FabricMC (https://fabricmc.net/). Feel free to use it, just be sure to credit FabricMC. Credit to me (OsakaPhysics) is totally optional, but I'd love it if you did!
